## **Challenges of Guest Verification for Hosts**

While short-term rental platforms share basic booking details like stay dates, they do not provide hosts with full guest KYC information, such as government-issued IDs or passport details. This creates several challenges:

#### **1. Legal Compliance Gap**

Hosts are required to collect detailed guest information to comply with local laws. Without access to platform-verified data, they must gather this information independently, increasing administrative burdens.

#### **2. Privacy and Data Security Risks**

Hosts often collect guest information via unsecured methods like email or messaging apps, leaving sensitive data vulnerable to breaches.

#### **3. Operational Complexity**

Manually managing guest verification and reporting can be time-consuming and prone to errors, leading to potential non-compliance and fines.

#### **4. Guest Trust Issues**

Guests may hesitate to share personal details through informal channels, impacting their overall booking experience and trust.
