2. TERMS
2.1. Commencement and Initial Term
These Terms and Conditions will become effective between the Parties on the Commencement Date and will continue to be in force for a period of 1 month from the Billing Start Date (collectively referred to as the “Initial Term”). After the Initial Term, these Terms and Conditions will automatically renew for additional 1-month periods (each a “Renewal Term”). The Initial Term and any subsequent Renewal Terms together will be referred to as the “Term.”
 
2.2 Pre-Payment and Pricing Plan Adjustments
Notwithstanding the provisions in clause 2.1, if the Customer either (i) fully uses up any specified Pre-Payment (if applicable) or (ii) switches to a Pricing Plan that includes a Pre-Payment among the Fees, the Initial Term or the current Renewal Term will automatically end. The new Renewal Term will commence the following day.
 
3. Access and Connection to the Platform
3.1. System Access and Initial Setup
The Service Provider will grant the Customer full access to the System and Services as per the chosen Pricing Plan starting from the Billing Start Date. However:
 
3.1.1. A limited range of the System’s functionalities (excluding any chargeable Services), as determined solely by the Service Provider, may be accessible to the Customer from the Commencement Date. This is contingent on the Customer following instructions sent by the Service Provider to the email address provided by the Customer via the Website (if applicable). The Customer should not upload any personal data (other than that of the individual uploading it, unless that individual is also an Applicant) into the System before the Billing Start Date. Any output generated by the Service Provider from data uploaded by the Customer before the Billing Start Date is merely a demonstration of the System’s capabilities and should not be considered equivalent to the actual Services.
 
3.1.2.
